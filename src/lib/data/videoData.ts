I tried to emphasize on the local issues and struggles young adults in their early 20s go through when they first leave their home country. The team and I tried to explore several topics that students our age encounter and create the same feeling of comfort that sitcoms offer to their audiences.'

I worked closely with the director in the pre-production phase where I had to find locations suitable for the filmmaker’s vision and organize call sheets for the team and shooting days. Besides the operational part of the production, I worked on set under the Costume and Set Design department where I created the actors’ outfits and look as well as provided the set with the needed props and layouts.

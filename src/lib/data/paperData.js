		name: 'Framing Reality',
		summary:
      'Dive into the fascinating world where objective truth and subjective interpretation collide. Framing Reality: The Interplay of Photorealism and Encoding/Decoding unravels how André Bazin\'s advocacy for cinematic realism intertwines with Stuart Hall\'s encoding/decoding communication model. This article bridges the philosophical divide, revealing how films like Aftersun (2022) navigate between authentic visual representation and the audience\'s interpretative lens. By drawing on insights from Susan Sontag and Cesare Cesarino, the piece sheds light on how cinematic meaning evolves, influenced by both the filmmaker\'s intent and the viewer\'s perspective.',

		name: 'The Bald Truth',
		summary:
			'This paper explores the loss of hair as a symbol of power and monstrosity through a comparative analysis of Voldemort, specficially in  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and The Bald Man, the antagonist from a children’s story in Romanian folklore, The Story of Harap-Alb. By linking physical traits to malevolence and dominance, the paper reveals how baldness has evolved as a highlight of masculinity, aggression, and fear across cultures in an era of globalisation. It offers a new perspective on the intersection of appearance, narrative, and power in media.',

		name: 'When AI Meets Anderson',
		summary:
			'This paper delves into the tension between cinematic realism and audience interpretation, juxtaposing André Bazin’s philosophy of photography, specifically photorealism with Stuart Hall’s encoding/decoding model. Using the film Aftersun (Wells, 2022) as a case study, it explores how objective imagery intertwines with subjective meaning-making. The analysis bridges philosophical debates on cinema, revealing how visual media both reflects and shapes individual and cultural perceptions, creating meaning through framing, image, and colours.',

		name: 'When Lyrics Cross Borders',
		summary:
			'This paper explores the interplay between American and Romanian rap music, focusing on glocalization – the blend of local and global identities, and pop cosmopolitanism. Through a comparative analysis of two iconic rap songs, the research investigates how global influences shape local music cultures while preserving national identity. Additionally, the essay analyses the visual parallels between Romanian and American music videos in terms of mise-en-scène, cinemtography, and design, revealing a blend of cultural elements that resonate with both local and global audiences. By highlighting the adaptation of global rap templates to reflect Romanian experiences, the study underscores the dynamic relationship between cultural hybridity and localized expression in the globalized music industry.',

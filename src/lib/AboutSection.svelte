				I am currently studying Media and Culture at the University of Amsterdam. Whether shaping
				narratives on screen or delving into visual theories, my degree taught me how to create
				projects that resonate across disciplines. My studies aimed to further improve a foundation
				in both critical analysis and creative practice which equipped me with a skillset that
				combines theoretical insights with practical applications.
			</p>

			<p class="text-justify">
				From exploring visual and cultural theories to crossover media, I learned the significance
				of impactful storytelling on screen and cultivated a set of abilities that bridges the gap
				between academic inquiry and artistic expression.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Throughout my degree, I have worked on projects that draw from diverse mediums and topics
				such as short films, talk shows, and video essays covering topics of mental health, AI,
				music, and adulthood. In this sense, I had to opportunity to delve, explore, and create
				versatile projects on a scope of projects which play a foundational role in our everyday
				lives and in the media.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				The creation process of thought-provoking and visually engaging videography has expanded my
				technical abilities and deepened my understanding of how media and culture intersect and
				influence the art field and society. Hereinafter, I am eager to bring this interdisciplinary
				approach to my Masterâ€™s studies, further refining my ability to create impactful and
				innovative visual work.
